## Key Concepts

### Wealth Phases
1. **Foundation (â‚¬0-50k)**: Emergency fund + OST + Index funds
2. **Growth (â‚¬50k-200k)**: Diversification + Tax optimization
3. **Optimization (â‚¬200k-500k)**: Geographic arbitrage planning
4. **Freedom (â‚¬500k+)**: International diversification

### Tax Strategy
- Prioritize OST account (â‚¬50k tax-deferred limit)
- Use accumulating ETFs to defer taxes
- Hold investments forever (selling = 30%+ tax)
- Consider geographic arbitrage at â‚¬200k+

### Investment Rules
- UCITS ETFs only (no US-domiciled funds)
- Low-cost everything (fees compound with taxes)
- Use Nordnet/Degiro (avoid Finnish bank fees)
- Simple portfolio structure (complexity = tax nightmare)
